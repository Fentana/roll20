aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth
rega ins hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.

Lair Actions
The aboleth casts phantasmal force (no components
required) on any number of creatures it can see within
60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this
effect, the aboleth can't take other lair actions. If a target
succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends
for it, the target is immune to the aboleth's phantasmal
force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a
creature can choose to be affected.
� Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward
in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground
within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14
Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into
the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can't use
this lair action again until it has used a different one.
Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit
for the creature's rage. The aboleth can target any
number of creatures it can see in such water within 90
feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom
saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The
aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used
a different one.

Regional Effects

Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's
lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.
� Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally
fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such
water vomit it within minutes.
� As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image
of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear
at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any
location a creature charmed by the aboleth can currently
see. Once created, the image lasts for as long
as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating
on a spell. Although the image is intangible,
it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The
aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the
image's position as if present at that position. If the
image takes any damage, it disappears.
If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the
course of 3d 10 days.
